# tsopenxr

"truly simple OpenXR" - Single-file header for simple OpenXR use with C, with no reliance on any other libraries (but does use/include rawdraw for context+demo)  It's been tested on Windows with TinyCC and GCC.

This project is based on a combination of this minimal OpenXR demo (if you just want to know how to use and don't want a mini engine) https://github.com/cnlohr/openxr-minimal

But it's more a engine-ification of https://github.com/hyperlogic/openxrstub/blob/main/src/main.cpp
